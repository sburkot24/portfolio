Our leashes were constantly ending up in random places so printed these little holders that fit neatly on the side of our entry way table. 

Key features:

* Feet to restrict rotation when putting on or removing leashes
* Cylinder to place leash clip so it does not fall to the ground



This is v3. First print was 2 layer print to test fitment, v2 worked but had shorter feet and did not have the cylinder to place the leash clip which caused it to slip off frequently. v2 also broke so inceased the density for v3. Expect I will print a v4 with a higher leash clip mount.

Love a functional print
