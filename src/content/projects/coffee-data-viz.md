## Overview

A comprehensive data analysis examining 38 instant coffees from James Hoffmann's bracket competition. This visualization explores whether premium pricing correlates with quality, and investigates how factors like bean type, fair trade certification, and origin affect both cost and taste ratings.

## Key Findings

### Price & Quality Connection

The analysis suggests paying more does increase the chance of having a better cup of coffee, with a notable price threshold around £3.50 per 100g where coffees begin advancing past early rounds.

### Bean Type Matters

Arabica beans dominated the competition, with all coffees reaching round three containing at least some arabica. This premium bean type also commanded higher average prices (£4.33/100g).

### Fair Trade Paradox

Surprisingly, FairTrade Marked coffee was on average slightly cheaper (£3.52/100g) than unmarked products (£3.97/100g), challenging assumptions about ethical sourcing costs.

### The Organic Triangle

The four organic entries fell into what I've termed the "Organic Triangle"—expensive yet poor-performing, suggesting premium environmental practices don't guarantee consumer satisfaction.

### Origin Transparency

Coffees displaying country of origin commanded higher prices but generally performed better overall.

## Data Limitations

The bracket format limits granularity, organic and origin data samples are small, and information gathering was incomplete across all 38 products.
