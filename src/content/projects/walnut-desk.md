## Overview

A custom standing desk built around a stunning live-edge walnut slab, combining traditional woodworking techniques with modern motorized height adjustment for the perfect work-from-home setup.

## Design Goals

- **Natural Beauty**: Showcase the walnut's grain and live edge
- **Functionality**: Full height adjustment range (27" to 47")
- **Durability**: Built to last generations
- **Minimalism**: Clean lines and hidden cable management

## Materials

### Wood Selection

The desk top is a single 8-foot walnut slab, 2.5" thick, sourced from a local sawmill. It was kiln-dried to 8% moisture content before milling.

### Frame

- Heavy-duty steel frame powder-coated in matte black
- Dual-motor electric lift system
- Memory presets for sitting and standing heights

## Build Process

### Slab Preparation

1. Flattening with router sled
2. Hand-planing to final thickness
3. Bow-tie inlays to stabilize natural cracks
4. Progressive sanding through 400 grit

### Finishing

Applied 5 coats of arm-r-seal oil-based finish, wet-sanding between coats for a smooth, durable surface that highlights the natural grain.

## Lessons Learned

Working with live-edge slabs requires patience and flexibility. Several design decisions evolved as the wood revealed its character during the flattening process.
