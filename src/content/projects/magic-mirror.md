## Overview

The Magic Mirror project combines a two-way mirror with a Raspberry Pi-powered display to create an interactive, information-rich mirror for the home.

## Features

- **Weather Display**: Real-time weather conditions and 5-day forecast
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar sync for upcoming events
- **News Headlines**: Curated news feed from configurable sources
- **Voice Control**: Optional Alexa integration for hands-free interaction
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add custom modules for additional functionality

## Technical Details

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)
- 24" LCD Monitor
- Two-way acrylic mirror
- Custom wooden frame
- PIR motion sensor for auto wake/sleep

### Software

- MagicMirror² platform
- Custom modules for calendar and weather
- Node.js backend
- PM2 for process management

## Build Process

The frame was constructed from walnut hardwood with hand-cut joinery. The electronics are housed in a custom enclosure behind the mirror, with careful cable management to maintain a clean appearance.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons about combining traditional woodworking with modern electronics, as well as the importance of thermal management in enclosed spaces.
