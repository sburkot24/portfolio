## Overview

The Magic Mirror is a smart display project that combines woodworking with embedded computing. The piece features a 21.5" monitor housed in a custom walnut frame, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3.

This was the first project I was excited to embark on after college, enabled by newfound access to tools, workspace, funding, and time.

## Timeline

- **2017**: First built
- **2018**: Stained and rebuilt
- **2021**: Hung and displayed

## Construction

The frame is crafted from walnut and finished with Tung oil varnish. The hardest part was finding a good place to stain the frame while living in an apartment without proper ventilation—but the end result is definitely worth it.

## Functionality

The mirror displays various information modules including:

- Clock
- Weather data
- World clock
- Custom sheets
- Water reminders

Built on the open-source [MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders/) platform with custom modules.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 3
- 21.5" LCD Monitor
- Two-way mirror glass
- Custom walnut frame
- Tung oil varnish finish
