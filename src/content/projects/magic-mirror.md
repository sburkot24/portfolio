## Magic Mirror

- First built: 2017
- Stained and rebuilt: 2018
- Properly hung, cleaned and displayed: 2021

The magic mirror was the first the project I was excited to embark on after college. I finally had enough access to tools, space, money, and time to build it exactly how I wanted. A 21.5" monitor is housed within a custom walnut frame finished with Tung oil varnish and powered by a Raspberry Pi 3. Finally got around to hanging it by wire and finding the perfect spot for it.

See below for more photos of the mirror along with some photos I took during the build.

## The Build

I didn't take many photos of the build but hopefully this is a rough outline of the process.

The hardest part were finding a good place to stain the frame while I was living in an apartment without proper ventilation.

Best of luck to anyone working on the project, the end result is definitely worth it!
