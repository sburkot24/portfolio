      <div class="prose max-w-none mb-12">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I'm an engineer passionate about creating impact through
          technology, research, and hands-on making. My work spans from buidling 
          and evaluating novel medical devices and diagnostis to data analysis
          visualization and product development to electronics and woodworking.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a background in engineering and global health research, I believe
          in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems.
          Whether I'm analyzing health data, testing new products in the field or 
          3D printing functional prints, I bring the same attention to detail and 
          commitment to quality.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification and Test Engineering:</strong> Buidling test cases, taking prototypes
            to the field, and evaluating performance in real world scenarios. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Health Engineering:</strong> Applying engineering
            principles to improve health outcomes in resource-limited settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Transforming complex data into
            clear, actionable insights through thoughtful visual design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Making & Craftsmanship:</strong> Woodworking, 3D printing,
            and other hands-on projects that bring ideas to life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that the best solutions come from understanding problems
          deeply and approaching them with both technical rigor and creative
          thinking. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and
          create something meaningful.
